# Spartez
Application for the Webmaster role at Spartez

Steps:
- Unpack my clean platform for a new application
- Completed title and start of content
- Completed content layout, transition to connecting scripts
- Finished connecting scripts and adapting

In this task I used HTML, CSS, JS and Jquery.
You don`t say anything about Jquery. I could do it on a clean JS, but I got used to Jquery and it saved me a little bit of time.

Thank you!
Have a nice day!
